# Terraform Framework,  2- and 3-tier for SAP VPC application stack deployments


## Description
This is an Automatic Framework Terraform IAC deployment of SAP certified IaaS with necessary storage, network configurations and OS SAP prerequisites basic configs.

It contains:  
- Terraform scripts for deploying a VPC, Subnet, Security Group with rules and two VSIs.
- Ansible scripts to configure 2- and 3-tier for SAP VPC application stack deployments.
Please note that Ansible is started by Terraform and must be available on the same host.

## IBM Cloud API Key
For the script configuration add your IBM Cloud API Key in `terraform.tfvars`.

## VSI Configuration
The VSIs are configured with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 for SAP HANA (amd64) for DB server and Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x for SAP Applications (amd64) for APP server and they have: at least two SSH keys configured to access as root user and the following storage volumes created for DB and SAP APP VSI:

DB VSI Disks:
- 1x 40 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - SWAP
- 1 x 32 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA (DB LOG)
- 1x 64 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA (DB ARCHIVE LOG)
- 1 x 128/256 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA

SAP APPs VSI Disks:
- 1x 40 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - SWAP
- 1 x 128 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA


## Input parameter file
The solution is configured by editing your variables in the file `input.auto.tfvars`
Edit your VPC, Subnet, Security group, Hostname, Profile, Image, SSH Keys like so:
```shell
# General VPC variables:
REGION        = "eu-de" # default value
ZONE          = "eu-de-2" # default value
VPC           = "ic4sap"
SECURITYGROUP = "ic4sap-securitygroup"
SUBNET        = "ic4sap-subnet"
PROFILE       = "bx2-4x16" # default value
IMAGE         = "ibm-redhat-7-6-amd64-sap-applications-1" # default value
SSH_KEYS      = [ "r010-57bfc315-f9e5-46bf-bf61-d87a24a9ce7a" , "r010-3fcd9fe7-d4a7-41ce-8bb3-d96e936b2c7e" ]

# SAP Database VSI variables:
DB-HOSTNAME   = "ep12db"

# SAP APPs VSI variables:
APP-HOSTNAME  = "ep12app" # default value
......
```

Parameter | Description
----------|------------
REGION | The cloud region where to deploy the solution. The regions and zones for VPC are listed [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zones#zones-vpc)
ZONE | The cloud zone where to deploy the solution
VPC | The name of the VPC. The list of VPCs is available [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/vpcs)
SECURITYGROUP | The name of the Security Group. The list of Security Groups is available [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/securityGroups)
SUBNET | The name of the Subnet. The list of Subnets is available [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/network/subnets)
PROFILE | The profile used for the VSI. A list of profiles is available [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles)
IMAGE | The OS image used for the VSI. A list of images is available [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-about-images)
SSH_KEYS | List of SSH Keys IDs that are allowed to SSH as root to the VSI. Can contain one or more IDs. The list of SSH Keys is available [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/vpc-ext/compute/sshKeys)
[DB/APP]-HOSTNAME | The Hostname for the VSI. The hostname must have up to 13 characters as required by SAP. For more information on rules regarding hostnames for SAP systems, check SAP Note [611361 - Hostnames of SAP ABAP Platform servers](https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/%20611361)

## VPC Configuration

The scripts create a new VPC with Subnet, Security Group and Security rules.
If you want to use an existing VPC with Subnet, Security Group and Security rules use the `sapnwanydbdistributed/main.tf` file as below and add the names to `input.auto.tfvars`

```shell
module "vpc" {
# source		= "./modules/vpc"   		# Uncomment only this line for creating a NEW VPC #
  source		= "./modules/vpc/existing"	# Uncomment only this line to use an EXISTING VPC #

 ```

The Security Rules are the following:
- Allow all traffic in the Security group
- Allow all outbound traffic
- Allow inbound DNS traffic (UDP port 53)
- Allow inbound SSH traffic (TCP port 22)



## Files description and structure:
 - `modules` - directory containing the terraform modules
 - `input.auto.tfvars` - contains the variables that will need to be edited by the user to customize the solution
 - `main.tf` - contains the configuration of the VSI for SAP single tier deployment.
 - `output.tf` - contains the code for the information to be displayed after the VSI is created (Hostname, Private IP, Public IP)
 - `provider.tf` - contains the IBM Cloud Provider data in order to run `terraform init` command.
 - `terraform.tfvars` - contains the IBM Cloud API key referenced in `provider.tf`
 - `variables.tf` - contains variables for the VPC and VSI
 - `versions.tf` - contains the minimum required versions for terraform and IBM Cloud provider.
