# Automation script for distributed SAP Netweaver and DB2 installation using Terraform and Ansible integration.


## Description
This solution will perform automated deployment of a distributed system (two nodes) with **SAP Netweaver** with **DB2** on top of **Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.6 for SAP Applications**.

It contains:  
- Terraform scripts for deploying two VSIs in an EXISTNG VPC with Subnet and Security Group configs. The VSIs scope: one for the DB2 instance and one for ASCS and PAS instances.
- Ansible scripts to configure SAP Netweaver PAS, ASCS and DB2 installations.
Please note that Ansible is started by Terraform and must be available on the same host.

## Installation media
SAP installation media used for this deployment is the default one for **SAP Netweaver 7.5** with **DB2 10.5FP7** available at SAP Support Portal under *INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE* area and it has to be provided manually in the input parameter file.

## IBM Cloud API Key
For the script configuration add your IBM Cloud API Key in terraform planning phase command 'terraform plan --out plan1'.
You can create an API Key [here](https://cloud.ibm.com/iam/apikeys).

## VSI Configuration
The VSIs are configured with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7.x for SAP Applications (amd64) and have two SSH keys configured to access as root user on SSH. 

## Input parameter file
The solution is configured by editing your variables in the file `input.auto.tfvars`
Edit your VPC, Subnet, Security group, Hostname, Profile, Image, SSH Keys like so:
```shell
#Infra VPC variables
REGION			 = "eu-de"
ZONE			= "eu-de-2"
VPC			= "sap"                         # EXISTING VPC name
SECURITYGROUP	= "sap-securitygroup"   # EXISTING Security group name
SUBNET			= "sap-subnet"               # EXISTING Subnet name
ADD_OPEN_PORTS = "no"                 # To create new open port/s on the EXISTING SECURITYGROUP, choose 'yes' or 'no' as options
OPEN_PORT_MINIMUM = "3200"            # This variables will be created only if ADD_OPEN_PORTS = "yes"
OPEN_PORT_MAXIMUM = "3200"            # This variables will be created only if ADD_OPEN_PORTS = "yes"
SSH_KEYS		= [ "r010-57bfc315-f9e5-46bf-bf61-d87a24a9ce7a" , "r010-3fcd9fe7-d4a7-41ce-8bb3-d96e936b2c7e" ]

# SAP Database VSI variables:
DB-HOSTNAME		= "sapnwdb2"
DB-PROFILE		= "bx2-4x16"
DB-IMAGE		= "ibm-redhat-7-6-amd64-sap-applications-x" # For any manual change in the terraform code, you have to make sure that you use a certified image based on the SAP NOTE: 2927211.

# SAP APPs VSI variables:
APP-HOSTNAME	= "sapnwapp"
APP-PROFILE		= "bx2-4x16"
APP-IMAGE		= "ibm-redhat-7-6-amd64-sap-applications-x" # For any manual change in the terraform code, you have to make sure that you use a certified image based on the SAP NOTE: 2927211.
