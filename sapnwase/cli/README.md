# Automation script for central SAP Netweaver and ASE installation using Terraform and Ansible integration


## Description
This solution will perform automated deployment of **SAP Netweaver on ASE DB** on a central instance.

It contains:  
- Terraform scripts for deploying a VSI in an EXISTNG VPC with Subnet and Security Group configs.
- Ansible scripts to install and configure a SAP Netweaver primary application server and ASE DB node.
Please note that Ansible is started by Terraform and must be available on the same host.

## Installation media
SAP Netweaver installation media used for this deployment is the default one for **SAP Netweaver 7.5 and SAP ASE 16** available at SAP Support Portal under *INSTALLATION AND UPGRADE* area and it has to be provided manually in the input parameter file.

## VSI Configuration
The VSI OS images that are supported for this solution are the following:

For Netweaver primary application server
- ibm-redhat-7-6-amd64-sap-applications-3
- ibm-redhat-8-4-amd64-sap-applications-2
- ibm-sles-15-3-amd64-sap-applications-2

The VSIs should have least two SSH keys configured to access as root user and the following storage volumes created for DB and SAP APP VSI:

SAP Netweaver PAS VSI Disks:
- 1 x 32 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA
- 1x 32 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - SWAP
- 1 x 64 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA
- 1 x 128 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA
- 1 x 256 GB disk with 10 IOPS / GB - DATA

## IBM Cloud API Key
Your IBM Cloud API Key will be asked interactively during terraform plan step.

## Input parameter file

 - `integration.tf` - contains the integration code that brings the SAP variabiles from Terraform to Ansible.
 - `main.tf` - contains the configuration of the VSI for SAP single tier deployment.
 - `provider.tf` - contains the IBM Cloud Provider data in order to run `terraform init` command.
 - `variables.tf` - contains variables for the VPC and VSI
 - `versions.tf` - contains the minimum required versions for terraform and IBM Cloud provider.
 - `output.tf` - contains the code for the information to be displayed after the VSI is created (Hostname, Private IP, Public IP)

## Steps to reproduce:

For initializing terraform:

```shell
terraform init
```

For planning phase:

```shell
terraform plan --out plan1
# you will be asked for the following sensitive variables: 'ibmcloud_api_key'  and  'sap_main_password'.
```

For apply phase:

```shell
terraform apply "plan1"
```
